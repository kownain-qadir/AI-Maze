# AI-Maze

The AI Maze Game Competition is an innovative project that aims to demonstrate and compare the capabilities of three different search algorithms: Dijkstra, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS) within the context of a maze-solving game. 

This project provides an engaging platform to showcase how these algorithms navigate through a maze environment and make decisions to reach the goal while competing against each other.
